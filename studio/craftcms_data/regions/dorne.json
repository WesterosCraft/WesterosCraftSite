    "copy": "<p><strong>Ghost Hill</strong> is one of the premiere harbors for traders and travellers sailing between southern Westeros and Essos. Dornish travellers wishing to sail north might consider setting out from Ghost Hill, so as not to risk their lives in the Stepstones amidst the pirates and mercenaries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>House Toland</strong> is noted for \"successfully resisting\" Aegon the Conquerer's dragon conquest. Rather than face them on the field of battle or a siege, they instead left behind their fool to fight as a champion while the noble family and their army escaped into the sands. They returned some time later, after Aegon had moved on.</p>\r\n<p>Their sigil is a green dragon biting it's own tail (a.k.a an ouroborous) on yellow.<br></p>\r\n<ul></ul>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Harbor,</strong> a lively harbor for all the coastal fisherman. Most of the sustenance in Ghost Hill comes from these hard working individuals!</li><li><strong>Caravanserai,</strong> a large caravanserai for land traders braving the drylands and parched plains.</li><li><strong>Temple to R'hollr,</strong> a temple to the red god! Ghost Hill lies in close proximity to Tyrosh in Essos, where the red god's faith thrives.</li><li><strong>Sea Cave,</strong> a secret sea cave for the castle's inhabitants to use.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>While there had never been an approved Ghost Hill beforehand, there were a few failed applications. Until the current Ghost Hill, it had been known as a \"cursed\" build. If you compare SMP's first app, a year prior, you can see the similarities to the final Ghost Hill.</p>\r\n<p>Cuhthomas' App (Early 2012) </p>\r\n<p>Georni's App (Aug 17 2012)</p>\r\n<p>dspa1r's App (Mar 7 2013)</p>\r\n<p>SMP's First App (Mar 24 2013): </p>\r\n<p>znda32's App (May 23 2013) </p>\r\n<p>SMP's Second App (Jun 27 2014) </p>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>Inspiration for the final Ghost Hill included a bell tower in Seville called Giralda, the white and blue buildings of coastal towns in Greece, such as Santorini, as wells as other features from Dornish builds.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/images/ghosthillinsp1.jpg\" data-image=\"102804\"></figure>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/images/ghosthillinsp2.jpg\" data-image=\"102805\"></figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Video</h3>\r\n<p>Ghost Hill was featured in the episode 58 of WesterosCraft Walks.

Anyone interested in viewing those images can check out the original application for the build. Other inspiration for Godsgrace came from our servers other builds in Dorne such as Vaith and Ghost Hill specifically.</p>\r\n<p>The build sits on the north side of an exotic river, so much of the planning revolved around how that land would be considered extremely valuable in the desert.

Known members of House Qorgyle in the books are Lord Commander Qorgyle, the predecessor of Jeor Mormont as commander of the Night's Watch, Lord Quentyn Qorgyle, and his son Ser Arron Qorgyle. In addition, Prince Oberyn Martell was fostered at Sandstone when he was younger. Sandstone is fairly isolated, located on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the deep sands, with the Prince's Pass to the north and Hellholt to the east. House Qorgyle holds a defensible position over the sandstone mesas, including a natural oasis. As such, they are an important pit stop for travelling caravans, providing water, resources, and respite from the dangerous deep sands. In addition, they also breed sand-steeds, horses bred specifically to endure the harsh Dornish conditions.<br></p>\r\n<ul></ul>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Sandstone Castle,</strong> the castle itself sits upon a large mesa, giving it a very defensible position. The castle is rather sprawling, having, in addition to a throne room and great hall, two general wings, one for servants and utility rooms and another for nobles and guests. The throne room of the castle also has a scorpion pit, allowing for a uniquely Dornish method of execution.</li><li><strong>Mesa Settlement</strong>, the main village lies within the mesas, where it is somewhat protected from the elements, and has direct access to the oasis for drinking water. Despite Sandstone being isolated, the village tends to be a bustling place, especially when travelling caravans stop for a few nights and trade various goods.</li><li><strong>Southern Settlement,</strong> a smaller village lies outside of the mesas, along the road to the south gate. This area is less protected than the other village, so it is less desirable. Most of Sandstone's animals are raised and butchered here, as it has access to more open space than the inside village does.</li><li><strong>Caravansaries,</strong> Sandstone contains three caravansaries, inns for caravans, each one situated by one of Sandstone's three gates. In addition, it also has two horse-breeding facilities, where Dornish sand-steeds are bred and sold.</li><li><strong>Caves, </strong>Sandstone's mesas are perforated by caves from general erosion, making it an interesting location to go spelunking. One particular cave, near the mesa settlement, has been turned into a makeshift fighting pit. The castle's dungeons are carved into the side of another cave, providing a convient way to dispose of bodies.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Emoticone11 and birdman7 first began terraforming on June 30th, 2014, and from there we plotted the villages, and then built the castle.

According to semi-canon sources, their motto is \"We Guard the Way.\" Their blazon is a black portcullis grill over sand.</p>\r\n<p>House Yronwood is an ancient family who once ruled half of Dorne as the Kings of Yronwood, with domains significantly greater than House Martell of Sunspear, a fact the Yronwoods let no one forget. House Yronwood established Yronwood in the high valleys and green foothills below the peaks and seized control of the Stone Way, the second of the two great passes into Dorne. Well protected and comparably fertile, their lands were also well timbered and possessed of valuable deposits of iron, tin, and silver, making them the richest and most powerful of the Dornish kings. The Yronwood domain reached from Wyl to the headwaters of the Greenblood, and, at times, even the Sandship of House Martell. In Nymeria's War during the Rhoynish Invasion, House Martell and House Fowler sided with the invaders, another reason for the deep rivalry between these houses.</p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Yronwood Castle,</strong> a large, fortified castle at the base of the Red Mountains.

Construction began with terraforming a flat area at the end of the Boneway where the castle would be located. The castle was completed after about five months, and then the focus was shifted to the sprawling surrounding lands of House Yronwood.</p>\r\n<p>The area is canonically a green belt, a fact not known at the time of the initial terraform of the area. So to fulfil canon, extensive terraforming was needed. Terraforming began with painting the preexisting sandy/rocky terrain to a grassier mix, and then adding fields and pastures. The most extensive terraforming was done at the Yronwood delta and at the marshes, which completely changed the landscape. At the same time as the terraform, the large main town was being built, which is composed of roughly 80 houses. Altogether, the terraform and the town were completed in about four months.</p>\r\n<p>The build replaced an older version of Yronwood.started NickShaiB in October 2012 and completed in February 2013. </p>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>Spanish castles were the main source of inspiration for the castle of Yronwood, such as Castillo de la Mota and Butron Castle. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/images/yronwoodinsp1.jpg\" data-image=\"102852\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/images/yronwoodinsp2.jpg\" data-image=\"102853\"></figure><p>The surrounding lands were based on desert floodplains, like the Nile in Egypt. <br></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/images/yronwoodinsp3.jpg\" data-image=\"102854\"></figure>",

The Daynes are famed for their ancient sword Dawn supposedly forged from the heart of a fallen star.

The Daynes subsequently became fervent supporters of Nymeria, supporting her in her war against King Yorick V <a href=\"https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/dorne/yronwood\" target=\"_blank\">Yronwood</a>.

Extensive terraforming was required due to prior attempts by other builders to build Starfall. The main terraforming was due to the island on which Starfall castle sat.</p>\r\n<p>The area is canonically home to the Stoney Dornish. Thankfully, the land at Starfall reflects this, and is rocky and relatively mountainous. As such it is not the lush area of Dorne which you would find at Yronwood, or the arid lands of <a href=\"https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/dorne/wells\" target=\"_blank\">House Wells</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The build replaced an older version of Starfall began by Starcat. The project lead took efforts to remain somewhat faithful to Starcat's plans.</p>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>The builders took inspiration mainly from the Royal Palace of Olite in Spain. This fit the fantastical nature of Starfall which many builders were looking for. The starfall town was inspired by the medieval towns and cities of rural Spain.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos</h3>\r\n<p>Starfall was featured alongside Storm's End and other builds in WesterosCraft Cinematic One, released in January 2016. WesterosCraft Cinematic Three and episode 117 of WesterosCraft Walks both featured Starfall.</p>\r\n<figure><iframe style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9bOeCaK4yx4\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure>\r\n<figure><iframe style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FI6c2DtilM8\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure>\r\n<figure><iframe style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/tPYSX1N8o-A\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure>",

    "title": "Wells (Dorne)",
    "slug": "wells",
    "copy": "<p><strong>Wells</strong> is the seat of the Dornish noble house of the same name. The village and keep of <strong>House Wells</strong> are located in the dunes north of the Greenblood river. House Wells was formed by a family of Westerosi descent who were exiled from their home. Members of the house braved the Dornish sands and stumbled upon an oasis right as they were about to succumb to exhaustion and defeat. Here, the members of this house raised a keep and vowed to aid any poor souls who stumbled upon their oasis. Members of House Wells are considered to be Sandy Dornishmen. Their faces are burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. House Wells' sigil and words are unknown, but the builder of this project has chosen the bright and lush colors you see around the keep as a representation of this house.</p>\r\n<p>The only known member of House Wells of Dorne is Ser William Wells, the heir of the house. He is a trusted friend and companion of Prince Quentyn Nymeros-Martell.</p>\r\n<p>There is also a House Wells of the North. It is unknown if this house is related to House Wells of Dorne.<br></p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Castle:</strong> The formidable keep was built by generations of members of this ancient house. House Wells has a very close connection to the Faith of the Seven. Some stories claim that the Crone's lantern lead the exiled ancestors of this house to the oasis which now serves as their home. Because of this, the family has centered the sept in their keep and dug their crypts underneath this holy building.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Oasis:</strong> The main attraction of House Wells' holdings. This luscious oasis helps irrigate the surrounding fields which have been strategically placed so as to obtain the most water possible from the underground spring.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Town Center:</strong> The cobbled town square is always very busy with merchants selling their wares and travelers strolling through with their animals to stay at the adjacent caravansary. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Motherhouse:</strong> There is a gray motherhouse in the village that is occupied by septas who dedicate their lives to the Crone and her teachings. These septas live out their days here in prayer and solitude with only the dry desert breeze to comfort them.</p>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Construction for this build started on June 4, 2015 and ended on January 17, 2016. Building of Wells took a rather long time as the builder was currently in school and could not work on the project very often. However, when he did find time, he accomplished a lot in a short time. The current version of House Wells of Dorne replaces an older version built by a past builder by the name of 'dspa1r'. The old version of Wells can be found at <strong>/warp oldwells</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Video</h3>\r\n<p>House Wells of Dorne was featured in Episode 66 of WesterosCraft Walks, hosted by HardzzGaming.</p>\r\n<figure><iframe style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EPSh_bc-Chw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure>",

Most of the rooms around the castle are now used as prison cells, some in use and some currently empty, and there are a couple of more comfortably furnished cells to hold noble prisoners. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>The castle layout plans went through multiple iterations, starting off as a smaller, more concentrated castle that evolved into the more spread out final layout.The island was completely re-terraformed for this project, as the existing island was too large for the castle plans and the terrain was also very outdated. Construction of the castle was relatively slow, taking over a year to complete.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>Stylistically, the castle drew on various castles from around the Mediterranean for inspiration, such as the the Spanish fort of Velez de la Gomera and the Aragonese castle on Ischia Island, Italy, as well as the Crimean Sudak Fortress. The build also drew some inspiration from Alcatraz, San Francisco, being a prison built on a small island, although the 1934 architectural style of Alcatraz was not thought to be fitting for Ghaston Grey. </p><ul></ul>",
