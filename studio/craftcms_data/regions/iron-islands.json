    "copy": "<p>The small towerhouse on <strong>Corpse Lake</strong> houses a minor branch of the <strong>Goodbrothers</strong>, just east of the family's main castle at Hammerhorn. The Goodbrothers' sigil is gules, a warhorn sable banded or (though this may differ from branch to branch). The Corpse Lake Goodbrothers are antisocial, territorial hermits that rarely descend from ther tower to any nearby villages. Popular eerie myths surround the branch, revolving around missing children playing on the causeway.</p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Corpse Lake provides little and recieves little in return: the small, weedy crops growing in their sole village in the woods provide barely enough to feed the residents, so traders find little purpose there.</li><li>The causeway spanning from the lake edge to the small island in the middle is slippery and mossy; many a traveller have met an untimely demise visiting the tower.</li><li>The towerhouse is made from black basalt mined from Goodbrother quarries to the west. Unlike many Iron Islands residents, Corpse Lake is able to afford as much wood as it needs thanks to the nearby boggy woods. The poison from the stagnant lake is slowly killing off the trees, however.</li><li>A small farming village sits on the lakeshore. The male residents are mostly either too old, too young or too sick to properly work the rocky farms, creating cause for concern as to food supplies come wintertime. The Goodbrothers are baffled to find that an increased workload and harsher taxes are not improving the situation.</li><li>The damp conditions allow for a diverse and varied amount of vegetation in the area. On the small chance a learn√©d botanist visited the area, he would find a rare moss growing on the sides of the tall trees, and some mushrooms only otherwise found in the Neck. The Goodbrothers are oblivious to this, but they have however managed to find a way to turn the mushrooms into all manner of relatively tasty cuisine.</li><li>Lack of trading influence means the towerhouse is slowly falling into disrepair, and, more literally, into the lake. It has been patched up numerous times over the decades, but as power dwindles, time is getting the better of the Goodbrothers. Rumours that Lord Gorold Goodbrother of Hammerhorn intends to send a team of skilled masons to aid his cousins are unfortunately unfounded. </li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Corpse Lake was constructed by builder OllieDisc in October 2013, and was finished relatively quickly due to the small nature of the build. The lake and surrounding woods were terraformed in and the biome was changed to Swampland to create the murky green waters and greyish, dead grass. A palette change took place after the build's approval, turning the more common plain grey Cobblestone and Stone Bricks mix into the darker Netherbrick and Bedrock tones the tower currently sports. The village plots were opened to the public using the average Iron Islands house style initiated by SMP in April-June 2013.</p>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>The inspiration for the towerhouse came from two sources: Castle Stalker in Scotland, popularised from its appearance as The Castle of Aaaaaarrrrggghhhh in Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and official concept art by Fantasy Flight Games.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/destinations/corpselakeinsp2.jpg\" data-image=\"100583\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/destinations/corpselakeinsp1.jpg\" data-image=\"100582\"></figure>",

Hammerhorn is the main seat of House Goodbrother, which has cadet branches throughout Great Wyk, among them are those who hold the towers of Downdelving, Crow Spike Keep, and Corpse Lake. They are one of the few castles on the Iron Islands that has a maester.<br></p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>The Hammerhorn Castle,</strong> is a large, bulky castle with spiked iron battlements with iron gates. According to the books, \"The hall was dank and drafty, full of shadows. One of Gorold‚Äôs daughters offered the priest a horn of ale. Another poked at a sullen fire that was giving off more smoke than heat.\"</li><li><strong>The Hardstone Hills,</strong> form the backbone of Great Wyk. Hammerhorn is one of the few inland holdings on the Iron Islands and has a prominent place in the hills, which are rich in minerals. The castle is also less accessible by land route, as described in the books: \"The way was rough, up hills and woods and stony defiles, along a narrow track that oft seemed to disappear beneath the horse‚Äôs hooves.\"</li><li><strong>Quarry,</strong> The castle itself was build from stones that were quarried from the cliff that looms behind it, and the entrances to caves and mines can be seen beneath its walls. A large crane assist in moving around the large blocks of stone.</li><li><strong>Mines and Foundry,</strong> near the quarry is an extensive mining operation. The raw materials are refined and made into weapons and armor. Presumably, Hammerhorn provides much of the iron that gives the islands their name and the raiders their weapons and armor.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Hammerhorn was built by birdman7 and NoahRYS in September 2013. In order to build the castle situated among the hills and cliffs, the region was terraformed extensively, raising its elevation and making it a harsh and jagged landscape. The valley was slightly lowered to make the castle occupy a strategic locations.</p>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>The castle is described in the books, especially its square design and iron battlements and gates. The quarry and mines were also mentioned in the books, but the builders made sure that they used technology available within the time frame of our universe. The town and buildings were modeled off others on Great Wyk in the Iron Islands style.</p>\r\n<h3>Video</h3><p>Hammerhorn was featured in Episode 13 of WesterosCraft Walks. DutchGuard explored the quarry and keep, and oddly in fitting with the theme of thirteen was interrupted by a thunderstorm and saw a mysterious glowing cheese.<br></p>\r\n<figure><iframe style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/O_XcXypwkdk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure>",

Two houses also have a little garden and there is a well in the centre of the hamlet. There are a few fishing boats and some fishing material at the beach. The only road away from Humble leads to Blacktyde. The towerhouse consists of one big square tower, a smaller round tower, and a staircase tower. The big square tower contains the dining room, guard barracks, three bedrooms, and storage rooms; while the round tower contains the kitchen and some more guard barracks. There is also a little basement.</p>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>The construction of Humble, Steineke96's first project, started with the road being terraformed by MrTXI and the beach by FlemishGuard. Then Steineke96 planned all the plots for the houses and the tower house. During the contruction of the towerhouse (done by Steineke96), Repsar, Syorre, Joseluisvlogs and Ze_Ramen_Guy built all the houses. After the completion of the houses and the tower houses, Steineke96 did some finishing touches and House Humble was completed five days later.</p>",

After the general shape of the hill was completed, he painted the final product. Construction of Nagga's ribs began after the terraforming was complete. 44 unique ribs of varying sizes and shapes were constructed over the course of 2-3 days and the project was completed in 7 days.

Most recently following Robert's Rebellion, Lord Balon Greyjoy created the Iron Fleet and led his own rebellion against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Iron Islands, like many of his ancestors. Although he burned the Lannister fleet at anchor, he was defeated by the mainland forces, his eldest songs Rodrik and Maron were killed, and his only surviving son Theon was given as a hostage and ward to Lord Eddard Stark.</p>\r\n<p>In the War of the Five Kings, Balon Greyjoy claims independence again, leading to a series of skirmishes and political wrestling involving his daughter Asha, his estranged son Theon, and his three brothers: Aeron Damphair, the high priest of the Drowned God; Victarion, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet; and Euron, who sailed the world on his ship <em>Silence.</em><em><br></em></p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Spires,</strong> the castle is built on a cliffside and several stone spires that rise from the Sunset Sea and are pounded by the surf. The different towers and keeps are connected by bridges, some made of stone and others wooden.</li><li><strong>The Gatehouse,</strong> guards the entrance to the castle complex. The walls of Pyke run in a crescent moon from cliff to cliff, with the gatehouse providing entry, located in the center portion of the wall and including an iron portcullis to provide additional protection should the wall be attacked. There are three towers to either side; the southernmost tower is new, made of a paler grey stone, after the old southern tower had been destroyed during Greyjoy's Rebellion when King Robert I Baratheon breached the walls. It is separated from the Great Keep by a high bridge.</li><li><strong>The Great Keep,</strong> is a massive grey stone structure and caps the largest islet. It is connected to the Bloody Keep by a covered stone walkway. Its long smoky hall contains the Seastone Chair, an ancient throne carved from a mysterious black stone.</li><li><strong>The Bloody Keep,</strong> or Guest Keep is one of the largest sections of the castle. It lies on its own island, further out than the Great Keep. Its halls are larger and better furnished. It received its name a thousand years ago when the sons of the river king, Bernarr II Justman, were slaughtered within it and their pieces returned to their father on the mainland.</li><li><strong>The Kitchen Keep,</strong> sits on its own island. It lies further out from the mainland than the Great Keep.</li><li><strong>The Sea Tower,</strong> rises from the outermost island at the far reaches of the island. It is the oldest part of the castle, and is round and tall. The base of the tower is white from centuries of salt spray and is crooked. To get from the Great Keep to the Sea Tower, one must cross three bridges. The tower contains the solar of Lord Greyjoy.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<figure class=\"article-thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px 0px 16px 20px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; clear: right; float: right; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(84, 84, 84); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; width: 300px;\"><a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/bc/PykeRenderLabelled.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150614142317\" class=\"image image-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/bc/PykeRenderLabelled.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20150614142317\" alt=\"PykeRenderLabelled\" class=\"thumbimage lzyPlcHld lzyTrns lzyLoaded\" data-image-key=\"PykeRenderLabelled.jpg\" data-image-name=\"PykeRenderLabelled.jpg\" data-src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/bc/PykeRenderLabelled.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20150614142317\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" data-image=\"quyfcb5si7q9\"></a><figcaption style=\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; text-align: left;\"><p class=\"caption\">The buildings of Pyke labelled on a render by Pizzainacup.</p></figcaption></figure>\r\n<figure class=\"article-thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px 0px 16px 20px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; clear: right; float: right; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(84, 84, 84); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; width: 300px;\"><a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/b6/PykeGIF.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150614142723\" class=\"image image-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/b6/PykeGIF.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20150614142723\" alt=\"PykeGIF\" class=\"thumbimage lzyPlcHld lzyTrns lzyLoaded\" data-image-key=\"PykeGIF.gif\" data-image-name=\"PykeGIF.gif\" data-src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westeroscraft/images/b/b6/PykeGIF.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20150614142723\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" data-image=\"2r1w8zh9hxlj\"></a><figcaption style=\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; text-align: left;\"><p class=\"caption\">A GIF of Pyke created by Contra.</p></figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Pyke was completed on October 5, 2014 as part of the Iron Islands redo led by SMP.

Their blazon is a silver scythe on black. All the other houses of Harlaw pledge fealty to them, including Houses Volmark, Stonetree , Myre and Kenning . Cadet branches of the Harlaws are located at Grey Garden , Harlaw Hall , Harridan Hill , and the Tower of Glimmering . The castle of Ten Towers was built as their new seat and is one newer and \"airier\" castles on the Iron Islands and also one that is culturally closer to the \"greenlands\" because of the presence of maester's, septons, and a library of books.<br></p>\r\n<h3>Features</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>The Ten Towers,</strong> the castle was built when the Harlaw's created their new seat and is one of the newest on the Iron Islands. The castle itself looks like ten castles smashed together. Each tower has different purposes (see below)</li><li><strong>The Great Hall,</strong> is a low stone hall with several hearths, and two scythes hanging above the lord's seat, the symbol for House Harlaw of Ten Towers.</li><li><strong>The Town,</strong> across a narrow wooden bridge over a gully is the town, which contains several small houses and sod-covered hovels.</li><li><strong>The Harbor and Large Stone Quay,</strong> protecting the harbor is the Large Stone Quay, which juts into the sea. Supposedly, there is good fishing from the quay. Within the harbor are three fishing ships and three longships, \"Reaper's Wind,\" \"White Widow,\" and \"The Lord Harren.\" Further out are two larger longships, \"The Lord Harman\" and \"The Lord Harlon.\"</li></ul>\r\n<h3>The Ten Towers</h3><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.westeroscraft.com/web/assets/destinations/Ten_Towers_layout.jpg\" data-image=\"100680\"></figure>\r\n<ul><li><strong>The Prison Tower,</strong> or Dungeon Tower (Tower A) includes guest rooms above and prison cells below. The top of the tower was damaged in a storm and is not used regularly.</li><li><strong>The Maester's Tower,</strong> or Infirmary or Rookery (Tower B) includes the maester's chambers. House Harlaw is one of the few houses on the Iron Islands that keeps a maester.</li><li><strong>Widows Tower,</strong> is so called due to the presence of Lord Rodrik Harlaw's sister, Lady Gwynesse Harlaw, who came back to the Ten Towers after the death of her husband and stayed for the rest of her life, grieving her loss. She often huddles beneath a pile of furs and stares out at the sea. A few thralls also inhabit this tower. The tower also serves as a lighthouse for the harbor.</li><li><strong>Stewards Tower,</strong> (Tower C) includes basic chambers for the castle's steward and some general storage.</li><li><strong>The Kitchen Tower,</strong> (Tower D) contains large Kitchens with a connected scullery and wash rooms as well as a few pantries, salting room, cellars. It has a family hall for private dining, servant's rooms, and is close to the Great Hall.</li><li><strong>Lord's Tower,</strong> or Main Keep or Central Tower (Tower E). The top few floors contain the family quarters with a common room below. There are rooms for septons, a small sept and rooms for thralls.</li><li><strong>Gate Tower,</strong> protects the entrance to the castle, has large barracks and an armoury.</li><li><strong>The Commanders Tower,</strong> or Barracks (Tower F) is attached to the gate tower. The commander's room is at the top with other guard related rooms below.</li><li><strong>The Spiral Tower,</strong> or Granary has a wooden staircase spiraling on the outside wall which connects to many other towers and is used to guard patrols. Inside the tower is storage for grain.</li><li><strong>The Book Tower,</strong> is a large, octagonal tower that is the most comfortable. Inside there are libraries and fireplaces, the lord's study, and common rooms.</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Ten Towers was built by JustCallMeeJack in Winter 2013 and was completed around March 2014. The general area was terraformed and the towers were laid out, but builders applied to complete each tower so that they all had an individual style.</p>\r\n<ul><li>Tower A (The Prison Tower) - ZanZan28</li><li>Tower B (The Maester's Tower) ‚Äì DutchGuard</li><li>Widows Tower - JustCallMeeJack</li><li>Tower C (The Stewards Tower) ‚Äì dondarrion (stewards tower)</li><li>Tower D (The Kitchen Tower) ‚Äì NickShaiB (kitchen tower)</li><li>Tower E (The Central Tower) - csn1984</li><li>The Gate Tower - NoahRYS and Nemeko</li><li>Tower F (The Commander's Tower) - NoahRYS and Nemeko</li><li>Tower G (The Spiral Tower) - Lyliana</li><li>Book Tower - Thamus_Knoward</li></ul>\r\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\r\n<p>The towers and town were inspired by other Iron Island builds and various images.
