The sound effects are from <a href=\"http://www.soundjay.com/\">Soundjay.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pond5.com/\">Pond5.com</a>, either paid for under an Attribution 3.0 license or considered in the public domain.</p>\n<h3>Tailored to Fit</h3>\n<p>In several ways, the WCRP has been adapted to help convey a true-to-the-lore atmosphere of the world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".</p>\n<p>Additions to the Textures have been made to account for the Religions mentioned in ASOIF like painted images of of the Seven (on the Dye Items), the seven-pointed star as a metal adornment on plaster blocks and the colours of the seven on a crystal glass windows and the enchantment table.</p>\n<p>Other textures e.g. the daub &amp; wattle blocks (on the Endstone metadatas) were created to emphasize the cultural and geographical differences between the regions of Westeros . The wealth or educational level of a build can be expressed by adding various types of (book)shelves, cabinets and chests that are made from different materials.</p>\n<p>The interior detail of a project is just as important as the exterior, which is why several blocks display household items (food plates on pressure plates, tankard on flower pot) or even foodstuffs (hanging sausages, hares, fowls on cobbweb metadatas). Just as George R. R. Martin put great effort into describing foods and beverages, we put great effort into recreating that diversity. Netherwarts have been retextured to peas, potatos to turnips and the creeper head is now a head of lettuce and lots of other ingredients have been added as the content of crates and barrels.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of textures that only differ slightly in tone or texture e.g. the sandstones. This helps to portray a realistic weathering or aging effect to walls and roofs of builds without creating harsh contrasts.</p>\n<p>This pack is purely a Creative Mode pack. Currently there are no plans to make this into a pack that works with vanilla Survival.<br /></p>\n<h3>CTM &amp; MCPatcher</h3>\n<p>In the <a title=\"Pre-launcher versions (page does not exist)\">pre-launcher versions</a> the RP made excessive use of <a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1496369-173pre-172-164-and-earlierupdate-127-mcpatcher-hd-fix-431/\">MCPatcher's</a> most notable feature, the Connected Textures Mod (CTM). The CTM allowed the creators of the WCRP to increase the amount of textures a block can display, by assigning textures to the <a href=\"http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_values#Data\">metadatas</a> of a block ID that the vanilla game did not use. The mod also comes with a set of different <a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1414510-a-texture-artists-guide-to-mcpatchers-features/\">features</a> on how textures on a block change with the placement of the block in 3D space.</p>\n<p>We learned a lot about the CTM by studing the Packs of <a href=\"http://fyreuk.com/\">FyreUK</a>,<a href=\"http://www.jslegacy.com/\">John Smith</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/69354-64x162-misas-realistic-texture-pack-updated-1jul13/\">Misa's Texture Pack.</a> We would like to thank them for being pioneers of CTM.</p>\n<h3>History of Resource Pack Development</h3>\n<h3>Current Situation</h3>\n<p>The current WCRP is specificly designed to complement the corresponding version of the <a title=\"WesterosBlocks (page does not exist)\">WesterosBlocks</a> mod, which has to be installed on a Forge based server and client. The WCRP features 177 textures that use various CTM methods, significant changes to standard MC blocks, a custom sky set with several moving clouds, customs sounds and lots of biome dependent colour-overlays.</p>\n<p>It is about 44 MB large.</p>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<p>In the future, development will focus on refreshing the item and sound portion of the Resource Pack.

        "redactor": "<h3>Preamble</h3>\n<p>All of our builders and guests have a vested interest in seeing the project complete. Not only does this provide a sense of accomplishment and completion, it also allows the map to be passed to our Developers, who will then start the process of using the map to create an RPG game. Currently, it's estimated that our project stands somewhere in the ballpark of 65%-70% complete, with major builds such as Oldtown still looming. One persistent problem we've faced is the aging process of older builds, and the desire by people to redo builds which are considered outdated. It is believed that allowing for redos in general would create a vicious cycle, where we would never finish due to builds constantly becoming outdated, or at the very least would set us back by a great many completion points. Consequently, we've operated under a rule forbidding redos in general.<br /><br />Thus far, however, the no-redo rule has been applied as somewhat of a precedent law. This has, in the past, lead to a large amount of confusion and debates about how the rule is applied. This post intends to solidify the no-redo rule, and to make it unambiguously applicable.<br /><br /><em>Please note that none of these rules or stipulations are new; they are merely a formalization of the cumulative discussions and precedent cases we've had previously regarding redos.</em></p>\n<h3>Definitions in Use</h3>\n<p>1. A \"redo\", for the purposes and intents of this post, is defined as the action of wiping clean all or most of a build, and re-building it from scratch according to new plans.<br /><br />2. An \"update\", for the purposes and intents of this post, is defined as (1) adding on to an existing build without removing the existing portions (for instance, adding surrounding lands which weren't there before), and/or (2) modifying the exteriors or interiors of an existing build without removing the build and starting from scratch.</p>\n<h3>The Rule</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Redos Forbidden: </strong>Redoing a build is expressly forbidden, under any circumstances, except for in the case where one of the following clauses holds true. Note that while appeals to quality or appeals to planning can be used as <em>motivation</em> for a redo, they <em>cannot</em> be used as reasons for why a redo should be allowed. Only the following clauses can be used to claim that a redo should be allowed:<br /><br />a) <u>Server Build Clause:</u> If the build under consideration is a server build, it may be allowed to be redone after extensive discussion. However, server build redos will in general be postponed until <em>all incomplete</em> server builds are either complete or in progress. When server builds are redone, it will only be done if the redo does not have substantial impact on the direction of our completion rate.<br /><br />b) <u>Inadequate Canon Clause:</u> If the build under consideration objectively lacks important canon, which directly impacts the planning or style of the build, it may be allowed to be redone. For this to be satisfied, the claimant must prove <em>unambiguously</em> that a substantial amount of canon has been missed. The claimant's case will be assisted if it can be shown that this lack of canon was understood to be an issue before they intended to apply for redo.<br />[UPDATE (12/16/18)]: Redos will be tentatively allowed for builds which get new canon in new publications, but giving mods the right reject these on a case-by-case basis depending on circumstances.<br /><br />c) <u>Abandoned Build Clause:</u> If a build is incomplete and filed under the <a href=\"https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/miscellaneous/projects-orphanage\">projects orphanage</a> as an abandoned build, it may be allowed to be redone. The intuition behind this clause is that it can be difficult to pick up someone else's outdated work, and if we expect people to do this very few people would want to apply to finish abandoned builds. However, moderators reserve the right to veto a redo for an abandoned build if they deem the existing portions to be particularly high quality.<br /><br /><strong>2. Updates Allowed with Stipulations: </strong>Updating a build is not expressly forbidden, however an update must abide by the following stipulations to be approved:<br /><br />a) <u>Sufficient Additional Value Clause:</u> The update under consideration adds <em>sufficient value</em> to the existing project. As there is no strict criteria to judge this by, it will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Some general principles are that an update is more likely to be allowed if it completes underdeveloped or non-existent surrounding lands. If a build has poor layout or planning to begin with, an update may be less likely to be allowed because interior/exterior updates are unlikely to solve the fundamental source of low-quality, and these efforts would be better allocated to increasing our completion rate through doing incomplete builds.<br /><br />b) <u>Abiding by Update Clause:</u> An approved update cannot, under any circumstances, turn into a full redo. If a builder attempts to get something approved as an update and then transition into a redo, approval may be revoked.<br /><br /><strong>3. Conditions for Lifting Redo Ban:</strong> Only once the following two conditions have been satisfied will we lift the general ban on redos:<br /><br />i) The world has reached <em>100% completion rate</em>, judged by a thorough investigation and quality check by the entire team. This may not necessarily include detailed terraforming and non-canon space fillers everywhere, but it does include at the very least all canon builds on the official project list. All WIP terraforms must be finished at this point in time as well.<br /><br />ii) The 100% complete world has been <em>backed up</em> and exported to the Development team.<br /><br />The lifting of the redo rule may be coupled by the introduction of a plethora of new blocks which we were previously unable to introduce due to aging concerns. Following this point, the server will operate under an \"incremental updates\" model: every time a redo is fully completed on the production server, that build is <em>ported</em> over to the development server in place of the existing one. Thus, the development server remains at 100% completion, but quality increases incrementally.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Submitting an Appeal: </strong>In the case where an individual believes a project is exempt from the no-redo rule, or believes a build qualifies for an update, they will be expected to start a new thread in the appropriate regional sub-forum entitled \"[Project] Redo Appeal\" or \"[Project] Update Appeal\" wherein a public discussion surrounding the project and appeal may begin. The moderating team will then by majority vote approve or deny the appeal. </p>\n<p>Projects approved under 1(a-c) for redo are open to all builders per standard project rules. While the original builder who appealed the project for redo will be given greater consideration, all builders are as welcome to apply for the redo through the formal application process as much as the original appealing builder.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion<br /></h3>\n<p>We hope that the formalization of this rule may prevent future confusion and debate, and allow us to consistently apply the rule in a way which does not bring fairness into question. Above all, we hope that this rule helps us to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and focus our effort to completing the mammoth task of recreating Westeros in Minecraft.<br /></p>"

This single rule covers it all. Treat others as you would like to be treated.</p>\n<h3>Rules for Gameplay</h3>\n<p>1. <strong>No griefing.</strong> Guests to the server do not have permission to build, but any attempts to grief the server will result in a ban. If you are a builder, we will consider griefing as a breach of trust, and will result in a ban. This includes altering or destroying the work of others without properly consulting them, or in their prolonged absence, the moderating team.</p><p>2. <strong>No items.</strong> Things that create entities on our server (items, minecarts, boats, arrows, snowballs, etc.) can really add up and start causing lag. In the same vein, don't place large quantities of paintings, star charts, redstone or interactive blocks or similar, neither on the Westeros nor the test world.</p><p>3. <strong>Do not attempt to download our map</strong> or parts of our map without our explicit permission. We are making an active effort to hamper world-downloading and will permanently ban you for doing so.</p><p>4. <strong>Do not abuse bugs</strong> you may find. Let a moderator or admin know. As for bugs with textures please report those to the <a href=\"https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/westeroscraft-texture-pack-megathread.34/\">Texturepack Megathread</a>, after checking back with others that it is not only a glitch on your end.</p><p>5. <strong>Do not impersonate</strong> Admins, Mods or other Users. This is fraud and will not be tolerated. Breaking this rule is an instant ban, with a small chance of an appeal being approved.</p><p>6. <strong>Give constructive feedback</strong>. Focus on how to improve the outcome, make suggestions, but accept that the other person might have their own view. Even negative feedback can be constructive if phrased appropriately. Refer to the Golden Rule.</p><p>7. <strong>Try to stay active and involved</strong> with the community. Check the forums regularly in case anyone is trying to reach out to you! As a builder, if you have been absent for more than three months you may be asked to reapply for builder status. </p>\n<h3>Rules for In-Game Chat and Discord</h3>\n<p>1. <strong>No racist, sexist, homophobic or any other prejudiced comments or insults</strong>. If you think you probably shouldn't say something, then don't.</p><p>2. <b>Show and book spoilers are permitted in discussion</b>. Press F1 to hide chat if you want to avoid spoilers. Intentionally spoiling someones experience is a ban worthy offense.</p><p>3. <strong>No spamming the chat</strong>. This includes, but is not limited to: sending a lot of messages, talking in all caps, and spamming characters (i.e. AAAAAAAAAAAAA).No advertising other servers or trying to recruit players on our server.</p><h3>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Our rules are visible both on the wiki and in the spawn town. If you have any questions, please contact a moderator and they will help you out. Here's what could happen if you start breaking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>. A moderator may warn you to stop what you are doing. Depending on the severity of your actions, you may receive no prior warning at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Kick</strong>. You will be kicked from the server. If the server is full, you may not be able to get back in for some time.</p>\n<p><strong>Mute</strong>. A mod can chose to mute your chat output for an extended amount of time, so that no one can read what you write.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporary Ban</strong>. This is a ban with a certain time limit, frequently 24 or 48 hours. You have not followed the rules. You have not listened to the warnings and instructions. Take some time away and think about what it means to be a part of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Extended Ban</strong>. This is a ban with an indefinite time period. After some time has passed, usually a few months or more, you are allowed to appeal your ban to show that you have changed and that you still belong on the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Demotion</strong>. As a builder, you managed to break our trust by abusing the Builder rights that have been given to you. This includes but is not limited to, building unapproved easter eggs, altering other players builds without consent, starting a project without mod approval. All of these could also be considered as griefing depending on the situation or frequency which will lead to a Permanent Ban.</p>\n<p><strong>Permanent Ban</strong>. You have disrupted the server to the point that you will never be allowed to enter again. Ever. Do not bother asking.</p>\n<p>Our rules are about following the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_the_law\">spirit of the law, not the letter</a>. For visiting Nobuilds there is a lower tolerance for offenses, often merely a single warning followed by a ban. Keep that in mind when visiting us.</p>\n<h3>Appeals</h3>\n<p>If you wish to challenge a ban, mute or demotion, you may post an appeal on our <a href=\"https://forum.westeroscraft.com/forum/ban-mute-demotion-appeals.33/\">Appeal Subforum.</a><br /></p>"
